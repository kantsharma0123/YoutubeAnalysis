<h1>Project Title</h1>
Top Indian Entertainment Youtube channels Analysis


# Overview  
 
In this project I have analyzed the youtube data for the top indian Entertainment youtube channels. I have used google api for scraping the data from youtube. I was able to extract cruicial information like subscriber_count, video_count,date_published_, like count,view count. Performaned various analysis using this data to identify trends for the viewers.

<h1>Technologies Used</h1>

1. Python 3.88
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Power Bi
3. Web scrapping using Google console API

<h1>Project Description</h1>

1. In this project I analyzed the viewers trends for various time periods and crucial sporting events like FIFA WORLDCUP 2022 And IPL 2023.
2. The stack used for this project is google-API-python-client" (which is the google python package required to access YouTube API data), pandas, matplotlib, Seaborn, python and Powerbi. 
3.  Initially I created a Youtube API Key which is the credential to access the google YouTube data. Once the key gets generated it can be used to access different YouTube channel’s data. The official documentation is provided by google on how to use the API to connect with YouTube data on python.
4. I scrapped the subscriber, view and video count for the channels T-SERIES, SHEMAROO, SONY LIV, SONY SAB, JIOCINEMA, SET INDIA, COLORS TV, BOLLYWOOD CLASSICS.  It was quite interesting to find that T-SERIES had the maximum subscriber count despite having much lower videos count than other channels. 
5. To analyze the impact of major sports event highlights I analyzed JioCinema youtube channel, since it recently acquired rights to broadcast FIFA WORLD 2022 AND IPL 2023. For a more thorough analysis on the trends I scrapped each video’s like, views and publish date for Jio Cinema.  
6. After extracting the data I used pandas library to clean and fine tune the data for further analysis. I also used grouping to find various aggregate parameters for the channel. I used matplotlib and seaborn to form various graphs to show connection between the parameters. I also used Powerbi to have a more advance analysis to see the connection between various fields. 

<h1> Major Findings</h1>

 1. Videos published by the channel in April 2023 were 3970.6% greater than in April 2022. Which shows just how much content is brought in by IPL 
 
 2. April 2023 saw 5553.06% more viewership than April 2022. 
 
 3. March 2023 saw the maximum viewership 442.1M, alone surpassing the FIFA QUATAR  WORLD  (Nov. 2022 – Dec. 2022) views by 196M approx. Which shows than craze for IPL is much greater than FIFA World cup.
 
 4. Nov-Dec 2022 brought in 247.1 million views which was almost 77.35% viewership for the whole year which shows than major content for that year was from FIFA WORLDCUP.
 
 5. Even though videos published in April 2023 were 180.4% greater than in March 2023 the viewership dropped drastically in April by 74.8%.This might be due to people switching to Jio Cinema App for IPL.
